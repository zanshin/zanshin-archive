This project is an archive of previous version of the website zanshin.net The earliest version
dates back to late 1995/early 1996. Versions were kept in directories on a file system until 
2004 when they were imported into a Subversion repository. Each identifiable version was "parked"
in its own branch in the repository. This was an error of ignorance about how to best use svn.

The branches have been imported to Git by following this recipe:
svn co <version 1 branch> zanshin
cd zanshin
git init
git add .
git commit -m ...
git tag -a -m ...
git branch r2
git checkout r2
git rm * (not really splat, but all files except for the .git directory)
svn co <version 2 branch> .
git add .
git commit -m ...
git tag -a -m ...
git checkout master
git merge <git branch>
...

This labor intensive process has correctly segrated the point in time snapshots that eh Subversion
branches (rel-1.0, rel-2.0, ..., rel-15.0) represented.

Now that the archive properly exists in Git the next step is to start cataloging the various WordPress
configurations and themes that are used by the site today.
