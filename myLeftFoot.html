			My left foot hurts.
			<br><br><br>
			It all started a few months ago. At first it felt like I had stepped on a rock. Hard. Initially
			I blamed my shoes. I had one pair of work shoes that had started to wear. The outside of the left heel
			was heavily worn. Also my sneakers were old and in poor shape. I thought that I was having some form of 
			cramp in my foot.
			<br><br>
			I got new shoes and started drinking more water. Still the pain persisted. Reluctantly I considered that
			I might have something wrong. My next birthday will have a zero in it. And a four. I guess some of the 
			parts are wearing out. Sigh.
			<br><br><br>
			Last week I went to the doctor and had the nifty picture below taken. I have a heel spur. The good news
			is that it is hook shaped. I gather the pointy ones are really painful.

			Luckily I don't face surgery to correct this problem. Several weeks of ultra-sound treatments should 
			reduce it. Since it is caused by some additional pressure on that foot I will be wearing better (newer)
			hard soled shoes to protect the area. I've also got some really soft pads to put in my shoes.
