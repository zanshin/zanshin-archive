			our four agreements
			<br><br><br>
			BE IMPECCABLE WITH YOUR WORD
			<br><br>
			speak with integrity. say only what you mean.<br>
			avoid using the word to speak against yourself<br>
			or to gossip about others. use the power of your<br>
			word in the direction of Truth and Love.
			<br><br><br>
			DON'T TAKE ANYTHING PERSONALLY
			<br><br>
			nothing others do is because of you. what<br>
			others say and do is a projection of their own<br>
			reality, their own dream. when you are immune<br>
			to the opinions and actions of others, you won't<br>
			be the victum of needless suffering.
			<br><br><br>
			DON'T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS
			<br><br>
			find the courage to ask questions and to express<br>
			what you really want. communicate with others<br>
			as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstanding,<br>
			sadness, and drama. with just this one agreement<br>
			you can transform your life.
			<br><br><br>
			ALWAYS BE IN YOUR TRUTH
			<br><br>
			your truth is going to change from moment to<br>
			moment; it will be different when you are<br>
			healthy as opposed to sick. under any circumstance,<br>
			simply be your truth, and you will avoid<br>
			self-judgement, self-abuse, and regret.
