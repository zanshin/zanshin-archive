our four agreements
<br><br><br>
BE IMPECCABLE WITH YOUR WORD
<br><br>
speak with integrity. say only what you mean.<br>
avoid using the word to speak against yourself<br>
or to gossip about others. use the power of your<br>
word in the direction of Truth and Love.
<br><br><br>
DON'T TAKE ANYTHING PERSONALLY
<br><br>
nothing others do is because of you. what<br>
others say and do is a projection of their own<br>
reality, their own dream. when you are immune<br>
to the opinions and actions of others, you won't<br>
be the victum of needless suffering.
<br><br><br>
DON'T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS
<br><br>
find the courage to ask questions and to express<br>
what you really want. communicate with others<br>
as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstanding,<br>
sadness, and drama. with just this one agreement<br>
you can transform your life.
<br><br><br>
ALWAYS BE IN YOUR TRUTH
<br><br>
your truth is going to change from moment to<br>
moment; it will be different when you are<br>
healthy as opposed to sick. under any circumstance,<br>
simply be your truth, and you will avoid<br>
self-judgement, self-abuse, and regret.
