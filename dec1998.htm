        goofed. So sue me. I left the scrolling off on a few of
        the frames. I've corrected that and hopefully everyone
        will be able to see all of each page now. I had forgotten
        how much work getting all the little bugs out of a web
        site when it goes live. </font></p>

        problem of external links openning in my frames by adding

        minor updates. Added scroll bars to those pages that
        require them. I discovered much to my dismay that not all
        of you have a wheel-equiped mouse yet. Go buy one. They
        are very cool. More content and some new pages. The ISD
        Countdown has returned, as has the Zanshin page. The
        credits page now scrolls all by itself. Hopefully this
        upload will correct the troublesome guestbook.</font></p>

        release 5.0 of zanshin.net. It has been online in various
        forms since November of 1994. In that time it has evolved
        from a single page of links to a multi-layered site
        supporting a dozen pages to its current apparence. This
        release of zanshin.net is the first that has links and
        pages relating to my wife, Michele's, interests. It is
        appropriate that this site was created on this date, as
        it is the third anniversary of the first time my wife and
        I met. </font></p>

        explore our site, sign the questbook, and enjoy yourself.
