        <p><font face="Verdana">For the past three years my
        husband and I have pursued our own personal perfection.
        Part of that journey is seeking Agapé. We believe that
        this part of the journey is best when shared. Towards
        that end we are offering to share a weekend with you and
        your partner. This weekend will be an intense experience.
        It will scour the depths of your soul, and fill you with
        love to the heights of your being.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">During this weekend we will
        explore the barriers that each of us has erected between
        ourselves and our goals. You will learn techniques and
        tools that will improve your communication with your
        partner, and more importantly, with yourself. This is not
        a quick fix, nor will you be &quot;cured&quot; by
        attending. Instead this is a course in how to fish in the
        sea of personal relationships and goals.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">Any journey beings with but a
        single step, we feel that this is a very good first step.
