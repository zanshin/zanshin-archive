                term which means 'total love and acceptance. We
                believe that this is the ultimate goal of every
                essence living on this planet; to atain a state
                of agapé. </font><p><font face="Verdana">Most of
                us learn conditional love and conditional
                acceptance from our life experiences. This input
                comes at us from all sides. Our families,
                schools, media, friends, and indeed, ourselves.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">How many times have we
                all heard words to this effect, &quot;If you
                would only do this&quot;, &quot;If you would only
                be this&quot;, &quot;I love you, but...&quot;
                Over and over we are conditioned to believe that
                love is supposed to have strings. If you aren't
                perfect then you can't be totally loved and
                accepted. Of course this begs the question, what
                is perfect.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana">We are all perfect. Each
                of us is exactly the way we are for a reason. To
                learn something from this life experience.
                Fighting what we are in order to meet the
                popularly held ideal of perfect is to fight one's
                own nature. Fighting who you real are negates the
                very purpose of your life here. </font></p>
