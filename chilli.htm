				2 stalks of celery finely chopped<br>
				1 med to large onion coarsely chopped<br>
				½ green pepper finely chopped<br>
				1 clove garlic, minced<br>
				1 clove elephant garlic, minced<br>
				1 pound ground beef<br>
				1 can diced tomatoes (28 oz)<br>
				1 can tomato sauce (28 oz)<br>
				1 small can tomato paste<br>
				<br><br>
				olive oil<br>
				<br><br>
				chili powder<br>
				cumin<br>
				cayenne (red pepper) powder<br>
				anise seed<br>
				salt<br>
				pepper<br>
				sugar<br>
				Worcestershire sauce<br>
				<br><br>
				Heat a couple of tablespoons of oil in a large stew pot. Once it's hot add the onions, green 
				pepper and celery. Season with salt and pepper. Stir occasionally until the vegetable start to 
				soften. Remove them from the pot and add the ground beef. Brown the beef and crumble. Season 
				with salt and pepper. Once the meat is brown re-add the vegetables.
				<br>
				<br>
				Add the tomato sauce, diced tomatoes and tomato paste. Stir to mix well. Re-season with 
				more salt and pepper. Also add a pinch of sugar to cut the acid taste of the tomatoes.
				<br>
				<br>
				I season without measuring so the following are just estimates. Experiment on your own 
				until it tastes the way you want. Be careful tho... it will take a while for the hot 
				flavors to become apparent, if you don't wait a while after adding spice to taste test 
				you can make it too hot to eat.
				<br>
				<br>
				I generally start with a couple of tablespoons of chili powder. I almost always end up 
				adding more later.
				<br>
				<br>
				I put several good shakes of Worcestershire in, maybe a tablespoon. 
				<br>
				<br>
				A couple, three shakes of cayanne and cumin. Add a dozen or so anise seeds. Sometimes 
				I toss a bay leaf in for grins.
				<br>
				<br>
				Mix well and bring to a boil. Then reduce the heat and simmer with the lid on for 
				several hours. Once your mouth is watering and you can't wait any longer serve and eat.
