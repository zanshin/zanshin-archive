  Zanshin.net 
  Version 11.0 (beta)
  
  This is roughly the eleventh iteration of my personal website. Zansin.net
  has been online continuously since the fall of 1995. Originally it was
  my own portal site, before protals were popular. Gradually the site focus 
  shifted away from the external towards the internal, just as my personal
  focus was shifting away from outside me to inside me.
  
  I have been fortunate to find and be able to utilize the fine work of
  several people in the development of this site. Where their efforts are
  used, credit is given. I fully support intellectual property sharing.
  Economic advantage based on an idea is a practice whose time is drawing
  to a close. The fine hair to split here is giving proper credit. I have
  not knowingly used any scripts, images, or other artifacts without giving
  proper credit. All software used to create this site was either open
  source, or purchased. No pirated software was used in the making of this
  site.
  
  Enjoy.

He has gained knowledge and experience in project management, analysis, development, and system integration through 20 years 
of employment as both an employee and consultant for state government, public utility, manufacturing, and software development 
enterprises. </P>
<p>In October 2000, Mark founded Partition Software, in order to pursue a long standing dream of self-employment. 
Partition Software provides advanced object oriented application design services to the Fort&eacute;, Web Application, 
and Java communities.
<U><P>October 2000 – Present</P>
</U><p>In his initial engagement, working as Partition Software, Mark was contracted to the Illinois Department 
of Human Services. His responsiblities included project leadership, designing application architecture using UML 
and Rational Unified Process, and staff mentoring. Mark lead the effort to transition development environment 
from Fort&eacute; 4GL to J2EE. He evaluated and selected the Jakarta Struts framework as the standard for web application 
development at his client agency. He successfully created a Java/HTML prototype using Struts, and interfaced it with 
legacy Fort&eacute; TOOL application via IBM's MQ Series. Mark served as Project Leader for large-scale persistence project, 
which was completed on time. He simultaneously was Project Leader for rules based eligibility determination project 
that was completed 5 months ahead of schedule. Most recently, Mark Developed 60-window user interface for
viewing determinations in just 8 months.</p>
<P>Tools: Fort&eacute; 3, Fort&eacute; UDS 5.0.3, IBM DB2 Universal Database, AIX 4.3, Rational Rose, Rational ClearCase, Java, J2EE, Jakarta Struts, IBM WebSphere Application 
Developer Studio, Eclipse 2.0, IBM MQ Series, Microsoft Office, UML, and Windows NT 4.0.</P>
<U><P>July 1999 – September 2000</P>
</U><p>In his final assignment at Home Account, Mark developed software requirement specification documents for release 2.0 of a customer care application. He coordinated information, charted resource availability, developed prototypes, and served as a quality assurance resource for the project.</p>

<P>In his initial assignment at Home Account, Mark was a member of a team that developed a new <I>N</I>-tier, distributed presentation application for a client financial institution. Specifically he co-authored the software requirement specification document, designed several major components of the new application, and assisted in coding and unit testing the application. He also provided the new database classes and service objects needed to support the application. The presentation layer for this application was HTML, with Fort&eacute; serving as the business layer. Oracle and legacy system access comprised the data tier of the application.</P>
<P>Tools: Fort&eacute; 3, Fort&eacute; Express, Oracle 7<I>x</I>, SunOS 5.6, Rational Rose, Rational RequisitePro, Microsoft Office, UML, and Windows NT 4.0.</P>

</U><P>In his most recent engagement as a Technical Consultant with Analysts International, Mark was assigned to develop a 3-tier Fort&eacute; reporting application framework for a manufacturing client. He performed requirement analysis, application design, software construction, integration and unit testing. The client's goal was to replace an existing ODBMS report generation application with RDBMS reporting application. The framework that he created was successfully used to replace one of five reports from the original system. The client has undertaken projects to migrate the remaining reports to the new framework. In addition to the reporting framework, Mark created an event-driven data extraction application to populate Oracle database, using transactions extracted from the ODBMS. The framework and extraction applications implement the Database Entity Manager, Notifier, and nested window patterns. </P>
