<p> this is the text of my posting. it isn't very fancy but it is text and it is a posting and well I
just needed something to test this new look and feel that I am trying to put together for my web site
zanshin.net which is a nice web site if I do say so myself and one you should visit several times a
day if for no other reason than to be in awe of its utter waste of bandwidth and time.</p>
<p> this is the second paragraph of this useless except for testing posting.</p>
