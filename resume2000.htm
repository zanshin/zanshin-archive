<h4>WORK EXPERIENCE</h4>
<P>Mark H. Nichols is a application architect with an extensive background in developing mainframe, client-server,
and distributed applications. He is skilled at integrating 3rd party software on both desktop and mainframe platforms. 
He has gained knowledge and experience in project management, analysis, development, and system integration through 20 years 
of employment as both an employee and consultant for state government, public utility, manufacturing, and software development 
enterprises. </P>
<p>In October 2000, Mark founded Partition Software, in order to pursue a long standing dream of self-employment. 
Partition Software provides advanced object oriented application design services to the Fort&eacute;, Web Application, 
and Java communities.
<U><P>October 2000 – Present</P>
</U><p>In his initial engagement, working as Partition Software, Mark was contracted to the Illinois Department 
of Human Services. His responsiblities included project leadership, designing application architecture using UML 
and Rational Unified Process, and staff mentoring. Mark lead the effort to transition development environment 
from Fort&eacute; 4GL to J2EE. He evaluated and selected the Jakarta Struts framework as the standard for web application 
development at his client agency. He successfully created a Java/HTML prototype using Struts, and interfaced it with 
legacy Fort&eacute; TOOL application via IBM's MQ Series. Mark served as Project Leader for large-scale persistence project, 
which was completed on time. He simultaneously was Project Leader for rules based eligibility determination project 
that was completed 5 months ahead of schedule. Most recently, Mark Developed 60-window user interface for
viewing determinations in just 8 months.</p>
<P>Tools: Fort&eacute; 3, Fort&eacute; UDS 5.0.3, IBM DB2 Universal Database, AIX 4.3, Rational Rose, Rational ClearCase, Java, J2EE, Jakarta Struts, IBM WebSphere Application 
Developer Studio, Eclipse 2.0, IBM MQ Series, Microsoft Office, UML, and Windows NT 4.0.</P>
<U><P>July 1999 – September 2000</P>
</U><p>In his final assignment at Home Account, Mark developed software requirement specification documents for release 2.0 of a customer care application. He coordinated information, charted resource availability, developed prototypes, and served as a quality assurance resource for the project.</p>

<P>In his initial assignment at Home Account, Mark was a member of a team that developed a new <I>N</I>-tier, distributed presentation application for a client financial institution. Specifically he co-authored the software requirement specification document, designed several major components of the new application, and assisted in coding and unit testing the application. He also provided the new database classes and service objects needed to support the application. The presentation layer for this application was HTML, with Fort&eacute; serving as the business layer. Oracle and legacy system access comprised the data tier of the application.</P>
<P>Tools: Fort&eacute; 3, Fort&eacute; Express, Oracle 7<I>x</I>, SunOS 5.6, Rational Rose, Rational RequisitePro, Microsoft Office, UML, and Windows NT 4.0.</P>
<U><P>November 1998 – May 1999</P>
</U><P>In his most recent engagement as a Technical Consultant with Analysts International, Mark was assigned to develop a 3-tier Fort&eacute; reporting application framework for a manufacturing client. He performed requirement analysis, application design, software construction, integration and unit testing. The client's goal was to replace an existing ODBMS report generation application with RDBMS reporting application. The framework that he created was successfully used to replace one of five reports from the original system. The client has undertaken projects to migrate the remaining reports to the new framework. In addition to the reporting framework, Mark created an event-driven data extraction application to populate Oracle database, using transactions extracted from the ODBMS. The framework and extraction applications implement the Database Entity Manager, Notifier, and nested window patterns. </P>
<P>Tools: Fort&eacute; 2, Fort&eacute; 3, Oracle 7<I>x</I>, SQL Plus, Windows NT 4.0, Rational Rose, UML 1.0, and Digital Unix</P>
<U><P>May 1998 - November 1998</P>
</U><P>In his initial assignment with Analysts International, Mark was tasked as a Fort&eacute; resource at a manufacturing client. In this role he assisted in the completion and testing of several enhancements to a Fort&eacute;-based, ODBMS report generation application. Mark also developed a new report and user interface for a critical stage of the plant's manufacturing process. Throughout this engagement he provided mentoring to other developers and assisted in the creation of Fort&eacute;/OO development standards for the client.</P>
<P>Tools: Fort&eacute; 2, Objectivity ODBMS, Windows NT 4.0, Rational Rose, UML, Digital UNIX, and Microsoft Office.</P>
<U><P>July 1997 – April 1998</P>
</U><P>As a Senior Consultant with MSF&amp;W, Mark was tasked as Technical Lead on redesign of C-language document workflow application into 3-tier Fort&eacute; document workflow application. The existing application supported scanning and indexing of 10,000 pages/day in an archival process. The goal was to develop a Fort&eacute;-based architecture to match or exceed this benchmark. The new system design proposed a hardware platform including Windows 95 client workstations, RS/6000 application servers, and IBM 390 mainframe for optical disk storage access. DB2/6000 was the target database, IBM’s MQ Series was the messaging middleware, and Fort&eacute; was chosen as the application development environment. Mark prepared cost and ROI documents for client management. He also authored design development, project schedule, and hardware specification documents. </P>
<P>Tools: Word Perfect GroupWise 5.0, Microsoft Project 4.0, Project Workbench, Visio 4.0</P>
<P>During this time frame he also supporting a Fort&eacute; document archival workflow system. Mark's duties included performing performance tuning of static and dynamic SQL used within the application, which resulted in 10-fold reduction in response time. He also improved class encapsulation and reusability by restructuring nested window event handlers.</P>
<P>Tools: Forte 2, Fort&eacute; 3, DB2/6000, IBM MQ Series, C, AIX UNIX, Windows 3.x, 95</P>

As a member of the user interface team, that developed a wizard style interface to implement 70-question intake assessment, he was responsible for creating approximately 50 nested windows in 6 weeks. Mark used Fort&eacute; Express to develop database maintenance applications for developer use. Also, he used Fort&eacute;'s External Connection class to provide TCP/IP connection between the new application and a legacy COBOL system.</P>

</U><P>In his initial engagement with MSF&amp;W, Mark was assigned to code construction activities for 3-tier Fort&eacute; workflow application. During this time frame he developed classes, service objects, and user interfaces. Mark completed the wrappering of IBM's MQ Series functions to provide image transfer function between a RS/6000 application server and the IBM 390 mainframe host platform. For the host platform he developed a batch COBOL application to receive MQ wrappered images and insert them to host DB2 database and optical CD jukebox. Mark also authored the initial release of the Help file for the 1.0 release of the application.</P>
