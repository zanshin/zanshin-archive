        Central Illinois Public Service Company no longer exists.
        The people who worked there do, however. When the exodus
        caused by the merger announcment with Union Electric
        started, this chart was born. Originally a joke, and a
        not too subtle stab at management, it has become an
        important touchstone for the former development and
        systems staff of the Information Systems Department. </font><p><font
