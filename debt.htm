  For just over two years now, Michele and I have been working towards being debt 
  free. This is a relative term mind you, for us it means no revolving credit. 
  The only money we owe is for our car and our house. </font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#0000FF">How'd we do it you ask? 
  Consumer Credit Counseling Service. It's a not-for-profit organization that 
  helps people get free of revolving debt. They sit down with you and determine 
  how much you owe. This is a rather sobering experience. Sure you get the statements 
  each month, but when was the last time you added them all up? Then they help 
  you complete a budget sheet. They aren't interested in having you live as paupers. 
  When we did this exercise our counselor actually increased the amount of money 
  set aside each month for entertainment and dining out. Finally you arrive at 
  a monthly payment for your debt. They collect this money each month and distribute 
  it to all your creditors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#0000FF">What's the catch? You have 
  to give up all your credit cards. They hand you a set of sissors and let you 
  cut them all in half. Why would you want to do this? The creditors, for the 
  most part, suspend interest and finance changes as long as you are in good standing 
  with this program. That's right - no interest and no finance charges. </font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#0000FF">We have had some struggles 
  along the way. Eventually some of your creditors will report back to the credit 
  bureau that you've entered in to a payment schedule program. Buying a new car 
  with this on your credit isn't easy. It helps if you have a good relationship 
  with the bank.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#0000FF">Having said all of that, 
  nothing can match the feeling now that we are in a postion to pay off the remaining 
  balance. Imagine not have any monthly revolving debt. No more &quot;minimum 
  payments&quot;, no more 19.8% interest (or worse), no more calls dunning us 
  for money. And the icing on this particular cake? After 26 months of payments 
  we are used to living with out the 300 bucks each month. It will be easy now 
  to save that for the things we want to buy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#0000FF">The most important lesson 
  we've learned from this experience? Money isn't important. The things that money 
  buys aren't that important either. Sure, food and shelter are good things. But 
  who needs the latest and greatest of anything. We, as a society, have lost sight 
  of the truly important things in our lives in our mad pursuit of what the advertisers 
  would have us believe is important.</font></p>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2" color="#0000FF">My wife and I have a saying, 
  &quot;in truth there is love, and in love there is truth.&quot; Money is not 
  truth. It isn't based on anything but our faith in the government. It isn't 
  real. We are much happier now that we've stop chasing the almighty dollar, and 
  started following our hearts.</font></p>
