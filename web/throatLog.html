				monday food: rice krispies treats, sausage and pepperoni pan pizza (pizza hut), spaghetti and meat balls (mario's)<br> a good day. i had no trouble at lunch which is a first at pizza hut. i have avoided eating there for a long time because it seemed like i always had trouble when i ate there. today was a welcome exception. i may have to try it again soon to see it this was just a fluke. i did have a very minor mucus hiccup at dinner. it was late in the meal, after the last bite in fact, and one quick trip to the men's room cleared it. there was a loud, and rude family at the next table and i think the tension they added to the atmosphere contributed to my distress.<br><br><br>

				saturday food: waffle, sausage, pepperoni and cheese rice bowl, fish and chips (o'charle's)<br>a breakthrough day. i got to the underlying issues that are driving my stress. the new team member under my control pushes some of my father issues. pushes then hard. and i find myself reacting thru my mother issues. growing up i watched her react to him and now i am coping that behaviour. realizing what i was doing lifted a tremendous weight from my shoulders and eating suddenly became much easier. i had a slight mucus problem at breakfast while our discussion was still unfolding. however, i had no troubles at all during lunch or dinner. <br><br><br>

				saturday food: ham, egg & cheese bagel (mcdonald's), cajin fried chicken, dirty rice (popeye's), chilli-mac, scrambled eggs, bacon, american fries (steak-n-shake)<br>it was a very interesting day. we had our hair appointment in the morning. usually when we stop at a fast food place and eat on the run i have great difficulty with my food. i was able to eat my bagel, dry even, with no real trouble. as michele was getting a perm i had my hair cut first and then went to browse the book store. i finished in the book store and ducked into the local best buy. they had a sony pcgr505tl ultra-slim notebook and docking station for sale at just over a grand. this is a laptop i've lusted after for some time. after talking it over with michele i went ahead and bought it. almost immediately i started having second thoughs about it. we have other things we need to have that money for and so before we even got home i decided it wasn't a good idea to get this laptop at this time. back to best buy we went. it was surprisingly hard to return. i had paid cash and they don't to on the spot cash returns. even when the purchase happened 45 minutes earlier. sigh. now i have to wait 10 days to get my 1200 bucks back. we stopped at popeye's for lunch and i had no troubl eating at all. we played 'i love lucy' monopoly in the afternoon and had chilli-mac for dinner. late in the evening we both got the muchies again and decided to have a midnight snack at steak-n-shake. even thought the first two locations we tried were crowded we found a quiet one and enjoyed our food. four meals in one day with no incidents, not even a mild mucus problem. my kind of day.<br><br><br>

				tuesday food: rice krispies treats, chicken fried rice (china 1), pork, mashed potatoes<br>what a day. i had a flat on the way to work. the car was pulling to the right almost as soon as i left home. i made it maybe a mile down the road and pulled it over. driver's side front was gone. these are 245/45r17's. low aspect ratio to the max. i called audi road side assistance and they sent a guy out right away. at noon i went back to pck up the repaired wheel and tire. turns out the sidewalls are gone due to under inflation. oops. a visit to the local tire store and $243 later i get a new tire. ouch. lunch was spent chasing down a new tire so i did take out from the china 1. it was good, but i had lots of mucus troubles. three visits to the men's room - but no puking. after work the pool people were at our house closing down the pool for the year. more tough energy. these two only communicate thru yelling and threats. fun fun fun. more mucus troubles at dinner but nothing too terrible. all in all a pretty good day considering all the misadventures and stress i managed to find.<br><br><br>

				sunday food: chopped steak, baked potato (lone star), chocolate avalanche (harvey's custard), grilled cheese and mac-n-cheese, carrot cake<br>a rather emotion-filled day. michele's mom is having to deal directly with her brother again. the two do not mix well. clinically they would be considered co-dependent. we had talked yesterday about bring her with us to tampa for christmas. now it appears that she may be returning there with lee on her own. neither of us was real happy to hear this. i had a complete throw-up episode at lunch. only a mild mucus spot at dinner. we talked it out and michele called her mom back and i think that really helped. <br><br><br>

				saturday food: scrambled eggs a bacon with american fries (steak-n-shake at 4 am), chopped steak and baked potato, english muffin pizzas<br>the electrician came early and we now have a functioning pool. hot-damn-diggity.the stress of the past two weeks of construction have really taken a toll on both of us. we are tired, excited, stressed out, laughing like little kids, grouchy, and generally worn out.with just a slight mucus incident at lunch i managed to have a good eating day.<Br><br>friday food: frosted flakes, sliced turkey with american cheese on rye, potato chips, chicken soup<br>what a day. i took the day off  to have a 4-day weekend and ended up spending most of it watching the finishing touches on our pool. the concrete pour was done and the equipment plumbed. it was a stressful as it was exciting. i had slight difficulties with each meal. of course we did get to swim in our brand new pool for the first time (it was mighty chilly, but fun).<br><br><br>

				thursday food: rice krispie treat, medium-hot chilli (the den), sausage and pepperoni pizza (pizza hut)<br>a good day. since i am taking tomorrow off this was a virtual friday. those are always good. our tivo has been returned from the repair shop and tonight was it's return to use. of course the fucking cable box wasn't on for the first 30 minutes so we only got half of our favorite show. luckily this happened after i was done eating for the day. sometimes i could just walk away from all technology. when it sucks, it really sucks.<br><br><br>

				wednesday food: rice krispies treats, sausage and pepperoni pizza (monical's), leftover sheppard's pie, vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup<br>my sinus were on the move today. moving from their home in my head to my stomach via my throat. yuck. both at lunch and dinner i had mucus troubles. i either need to take benadryl regularly, or see a doctor for shots. phooey.<br><Br>tuesday food: rice krispies treats, bacon double cheeseburger and fries (steak-n-shake), meatless pasta<br>a good day. although my sinus cycle was getting worse i managed to eat with no real difficulties. it's always harder to eat and swallow when my throat is partially full with mucus from my sinuses. disgusting, i know, but true.<br><br>monday food: rice krispies treats, meduim-hot chilli (the den), szechuan chicken and egg drop soup (new china)<br>not a bad day for a monday. we tried a new chinese restuarant this evening. it was quite good. i haven't had a decent szechuan chicken since we left vancouver over two years ago. it was very nice.<br><br><br>

				sunday food: grand slam scrambled (denny's), dirty rice, home made french onion soup (awesome!), pineapple pork roast<br>a wonderful sunday at home. after a quick breakfast out we stopped at the store to get the few things we needed for dinner. cooking together is one of our favorite things, our hobby if you will. the pork roast was so-so, but the french soup was spectacular. michele says it is the best she's ever had and it is her favorite soup. no real trouble swallowing today. i did have a lot of mucus at breakfast that required one trip to the men's room to clear. otherwise it was smooth sailing all the way. hubba-hubba.<br><br><br>

				saturday food: sunrise skillet (bob evan's), chicken strips, tater tots (sonic), sheppard's pie<br> we had a good saturday. the newes last night from my brother that his family can't make the long-standing pool party date was extremely disappointing. both michele and i had a lot of things to say about it and we talked for a long time. even though i feel i handled it as weel as possible, i noticed that my mood was tenser today. i did have a lot of mucus at breakfast, but i think it was more sinus related as my nose was quite runny at the time. other than that i had no trouble eating today.<br><br><br>

				friday food: rice krispies treats, garlic and black pepper chicken (taste of thai), chilli-mac, pecan pie, chocolate cream pie<br> finally the end of the week. it has rained on and off since wednesday so no progess has been made at all on the pool. shit. even though michele wasn't able to make out weekly lunch out we had a great take out lunch at home. i managed to eat all three meals with no incident. this feels so very good.<br><br><br>

				wednesday food: rice krispies treats, bacon double cheeseburger and fries (steak-n-shake), dirty rice, klondike bar<br>not a bad day at all. i wasted three hours waiting for the electrician. he had to wire up the pool equipment. natrually he was late. in the end i left the pool people in charge and missed him by 20 minutes. phooey. michele is having a rough go today. we talked and it made a big difference. i ate dinner with no difficulty at all. ha.<br><br><br>
