    Spam. We all get it and, if you are like me, you are tired of dealing with it. I've had the same e-mail address
	for over 6 years now, so it is in all the lists. That one account alone gets 20 or more pieces of junk mail a day. I have two
	other e-mail accounts that I use frequently. And I have two ISP accounts that each come with an address that I don't use, 
	but still manage to collect spam.
	<br><br>
	Some time ago I set up a new rule in my Outlook Express software to toss all mail not from someone in my address book
	to a folder called 'Unknown Sender.' This works fine most of the time. Online purchases generate mail confirmations,
	and of course those sending addresses aren't in my book, so they end up in the unknown sender pile. This means I have to 
	visit this folder and cull out the mail I really want. What is left over is, in my definition, Spam.
	<br><br>
	The other day I had an idea... track all the spam I get in one year. It's all in one folder, and there is that handy
	counter at the bottom of the screen. So I added the counter to my index page.
