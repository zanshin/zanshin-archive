				1. What is your favorite time of year? Spring, then fall, summer, and lastly winter.<br><p>2. What is it about your favorite season that, well, makes it your favorite season? The budding of the tress, the grass turning green. The openning of my backyard pool. =)<br><p>3. What is your least favorite time of year? Why? The traditional holiday season. Coming from a somewhat dysfunctional family makes the silly seasaon from Thanksgiving to New Year's tough.<br><p>4. Do you do anything to celebrate or recognize the changing of seasons? Nope.<br><p>5. What's your favorite thing to do outside? Swimming, reading in my hammock.<br><br><br>

				1. What's your favorite animal? Cats. So free and independent.<br><p>2. What pets have you had in your lifetime? Two cats (current) and a puppy for 3 days.<br><p>3. Is there any specific pet that you've wanted but never had? Why? I've always wanted a bulldog. But I've never felt I had a lifestyle that was good for having a dog.<br><p>4. Are you allergic to any animals? I am sometimes bothered by cat dander, but I love my two felines too much to give them up over a little sneezing.<br><p>5. Do you have any 'pet' pet peeves (your pets or others')? I hate it when people get a dog because they think they are supposed to, and then they ignore the poor thing. Dogs outside at all hours of the day and night, barking at everything that moves. Such a pain.<br><br><br>

				1. What makes you homesick? <br>Not being at home, I guess. <br><br>2. Where is "home" for you? Is it where you are living now, or somewhere else (ie: Mom & Dad's house, particular state/city)?<br> Currently central Illinois. Recently South Carolina, and before that Oregon. Eventually someplace with good spiritual energy.<br><br>3. What makes it home for you? People? Things?<br> My home is where my Sweetie is, so anywhere can do.<br><br>4. Where is the furthest you've been from home, miles-wise? 5000. I did a two-week tour of the Alps on motorcycle in 1994. Awesome.<br><br>5. What are your plans for this weekend? <br>The spring rains have started, so we'll most likely stay home and dry, bake a chocolate cake and make a pot of spaghetti.<br><br><br>

				Something new. Finally. I discoverd a site called <a href="http://www.fridayfive.org">fridayFive</a>. The concept is simple... they ask five questions and you answer. So here goes.<br>1. What's your favorite vacation spot?<br>Anywhere I can go with my Sweetie-Pie. =) With her by my side everyplace is a vacation.<br><br>2. Where do you consider to be the biggest hell-hole on earth? <br>What makes a hell-hole?<br><br>3. What would be your dream vacation? Tine spent at home with no place to go, no one bothering us, and no time limits.<br><br>4. If you could go on a road-trip with anyone, who would it be and why? My Sweetie-Pie. We have moved across country three times in 5 years and are very good together in a confined space.<br><br>5. What are your plans for this weekend? Cooking, cooking and more cooking. Zuppa tuscana soup Saturday, and jumbalaya Sunday.<br><br><br>

				We are planning a trip to Tampa for Christmas. Michele lived there for a number of years and hasn't been back since she left over 5 years ago. He brother is moving back there and we think we can talk her mom in to flying down there to join us. The trick with this tri[ isn't the distance or cost. It's the flying. As much as I hate to admit it OBL and his band of terrorists has altered the way I look at travel. Our fears about flying ar minimal and yet they are there. Added to that is the knowledge that even safe flights are going to be very stressful thanks to the increased security measures. Our world has truely changed forever. How very sad.<br><br><br>

				I have a web counter on the main page of my site. It tracks visits to the site and I get a weekly report telling how many people came by. There has been a steady increase in the number over the past year. Two weeks ago I had 18 visits. This past week is was 27. Wow. This is amazing to me. I like that people are reading my thoughts, and perhaps coming back to read more. It is also sobering in a way. If I go a few days without adding something to the site I feel like people will stop coming. A two-edged sword as it were.<br><br>To all of you who are, dare I say it, regulars, I thank you.<br><br>Speaking of the web counter, I just switched to a new service. The old one just went from free to costing a nominal annual fee. The new counter is a little more ostentatious than I would prefer, but not too bad. <br><br><Br>/\/\ark<br><br><br>
