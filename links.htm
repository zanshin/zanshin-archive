I first discovered <a href="http://www.kevinandapril.com/april/index.html"
        target="anotherwindow">the wings project</a> when it was the ProjectCool site of the day. It has inspired
me ever since. Although I like its latest incarnation least of all.
<br><br><br>
<a href="http://www.souldanse.com/"
        target="anotherwindow">souldanse [dot] com</a> is simply one of the best personal
sites I know of on the internet.
<br><br><br>
<a href="http://www.asynch.net/"
        target="anotherwindow">alazanto: where the future is now ... </a> and where
presentation of web content is stretched to new boundaries.
<br><br><br>
I have always admired <a href="http://www.pbs.org/flw/index.html"
        target="anotherwindow">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>'s architecture. Now there is a web
site about him and his work also worthy of praise.
<br><br><br>
Wow! An elegant presentation of a beautiful subject. <a href="http://www.first9months.com/"
        target="anotherwindow">the first 9 months</a> is a tour-de-force.
<br><br><br>
<a href="http://www.soulflare.com/"
        target="anotherwindow"> s o u l f l a r e </a> is just that. Souls flaring brightly.
<br><br><br>
While it takes a short while to load, <a href="http://www.plumbdesign.com/thesaurus"
        target="anotherwindow">plumb design visual thesaurus</a> makes looking up words
fun.
<br><br><br>
<a href="http://www.killersites.com/"
        target="anotherwindow">creating killer wesites online</a> is that site that really
started it all for me. My web site design has radically improved since my introduction
to this online site, and the book of the same name.
<br><br><br>
Sure it's mostly an ego-trip, but <a href="http://www.kimble.org/"
        target="anotherwindow">kimble's homepage</a> has some great flash presentations.
<br><br><br>
Have you ever wondered what its like to fly? <a href="http://www.rewindplay.com/mxjournal/"
        target="anotherwindow">the ultalight experience</a> answers that questions in words
and pictures.
<br><br><br>
Another personal site done well, <a href="http://www.flaunt.net/"
        target="anotherwindow">flaunt.net</a>, has a fantastic splash/entry page.
