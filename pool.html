		"Let's build a pool," or, "Honey there's a fiberglass pond in the backyard!"
		<br><br>
		A year ago when we moved into our current abode we talked about looking for
		a house with a pool. But like most people we sometimes have a hard time letting
		us have something good. So we bought a beautiful house that has everything 
		except a pool. That is until now.
		<br><br>
		In the sping we started by visiting all the pool places. Most laughed when we said 
		we wanted a pool this year. It seems that traditional concrete pool construction is
		a slow process. All the local dealers were booked solid until next year. Bummer.
		<br><br>
		Then Michele, who loves to research things on the internet discovered fiberglass pools.
		These are molded in a factory and set into the ground in one piece. This greatly shortens
		the construction time, and the thing has a 30-year garantee. Best of all they could do
		it this year. And, while it is more expensive up front, there are fewer long term care 
		costs. 
		<br><br>
		Ideally the construction phase of this project is 8 days. This is assuming there are no 
		difficulties and no rain. We had two days of rain, and the installer was down for a day or 
		so when his bobcat lost it's hydralic system. Phooey.
		<br><br>
		The pages that follow more or less cronicle the progress of this adventure. The pictures were
		taken with a cheap digital camera in 640x480 resolution. I converted the images to JPEG format
		in order to load them faster here.
