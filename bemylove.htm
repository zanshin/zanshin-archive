  <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"> Come live with me and 
    be my love, <br>
    And we will all the pleasures prove <br>
    That valleys, groves, hills, and fields, <br>
    Woods, or steepy mountain yields. <br>
    <br>
    And we will sit upon rocks, <br>
    Seeing the shepherds feed their flocks, <br>
    By shallow rivers to whose falls <br>
    Melodious birds sing madrigals. <br>
    <br>
    And I will make thee beds of roses <br>
    And a thousand fragrant poises, <br>
    A cap of flowers, and a kirtle <br>
    Embroidered all with leaves of myrtle; <br>
    <br>
    A gown made of the finest wool <br>
    Which from our pretty lambs we pull; <br>
    Fair lined slippers for the cold, <br>
    With buckles of the purest gold; <br>
    <br>
    A belt of straw and ivy buds, <br>
    With coral clasps and amber studs; <br>
    And if these pleasures may thee move, <br>
    Come live with me, and be my love. <br>
    <br>
    The shepherd's swains shall dance and sing <br>
    For thy delight each May morning: <br>
    If these delights thy mind may move, <br>
    Then live with me and be my love. </font></p>
