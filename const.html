United States; if he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it,
with his objections to that house it which it shall have originated, who
shall enter the objections at large on their journal, and proceed to recon-
sider it. If after such reconsideration two-thirds of that house shall agree
to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together with the objections, to the
other house, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by
two-thirds of that house, it shall become a law. But in all such cases the
votes of both houses shall be determined by yeas and nays, and the names of
the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal
of each house respectively. If any bill shall not be returned by the Presi-
dent within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented
to him, the same shall be a law, in like manner as if he had signed it, un-
less the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return, in which case it
shall not be a law.

journment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and be-
fore the same shall take effect, shall be approved by him, or, being dis-

                              ARTICLE II

        Sect. 1.  The executive power shall be vested in a president of the
United States of America. He shall hold his office during the term of four
years, and, together with the vice-president, chosen for the same term, be
elected as follows.
        Each state shall appoint, in such manner as the legislature thereof
may direct, a number of electors, equal to the whole number of senators and
representatives to which the state may be entitled in the Congress: but no
senator or representative, or person holding an office of trust or profit
under the United States, shall be appointed an elector.
        The electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by
ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of
the same state with themselves. And they shall make a list of all the persons
voted for, and of the number of votes for each; which list they shall sign
and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United
States, directed to the president of the senate. The president of the senate
shall, in the presence of the senate and house of representatives, open all
the certificates, and the votes shall then be counted. The person having the
greatest number of votes shall be the president, if such number be a majority
of the whole number of electors appointed; and if there be more than one who
have such majority, and have an equal number of votes, the house of repre-
sentatives shall immediately chuse by ballot one of them for president; and
if no person have a majority, then from the five highest on the list the said
house shall in like manner chuse the president. But in chusing the president,
the vote shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having
one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from
two-thirds of the states, and a majority of all the states shall be necessary
to a choice. In every case, after the choice of the president, the person
having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the vice-
president. But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes, the
senator shall chuse from them by ballot the vice-president.
        The Congress may determine the time of chusing the electors, and the
day on which they shall give their votes; which day shall be the same
throughout the United States.
        No person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United
States, at the time of the adoption of this constitution, shall be eligible
to the office of president; neither shall any person be eligible to that
office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty-five years, and been
fourteen years a resident within the United States.
        In case of the removal of the president from office, or of his death,
resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said
office, the same shall devolve on the vice-president, and the Congress may by
law provide for the case of removal, death, resignation or inability, both of
the president and vice-president, declaring what officer shall then act as
president, and such officer shall act accordingly, until the disability be
 removed, or a president shall be elected.
       The president shall, at stated times, receive for his services, a com-
pensation, which shall neither be encreased nor diminished during the period
for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that
 period any other emolument from the United States, or any of them.
        Before he enter on the execution of his office, he shall take the
following oath or affirmation:
        "I do solemnly swear (or affirm).that I will faithfully execute the
office of president of the United States, and will to the best of my ability,
preserve, protect and defend the constitution of the United States."

        Sect. 2.  The president shall be commander in chief of the army and
navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several States, when
called into the actual service of the United States; he may require the
opinion, in writing, of the principal officer in each of the executive
departments, upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective
offices, and he shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences
against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.
       He shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the senate,
to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the senators present concur; and he
shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the senate, shall
appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the sup-
reme court, and all other officers of the United States, whose appointments
are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by law.
But the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers,
as they think proper, in the president alone, in the courts of law, or in the
heads of departments.
        The president shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may
happen during the recess of the senate, by granting commissions which shall
expire at the end of their next session.

        Sect. 3.  He shall from time to time give to the Congress information
of the state of the union, and recommend to their consideration such measures
as he shall judge necessary and expedient;  he may,  on extraordinary occa-
sions, convene both houses, or either of them, and in case of disagreement
between them, with respect to the time of adjournment, he may adjourn them to
such time as he shall think proper; he shall receive ambassadors and other
public ministers; he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed,
and shall commission all the officers of the United States.

        Sect. 4.  The president, vice-president and all civil officers of the
United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and convic-
tion of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.


                                 ARTICLE III
 
        Sect. 1. The judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in
one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time
to time ordain and establish. The judges, both of the supreme and inferior
courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior, and shall, at stated
times, receive for their services, a compensation, which shall not be dimin-
ished during their continuance in office.
        
        Sect. 2. The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and
equity, arising under this constitution, the laws of the United States, and
treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority; to all cases
affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls; to all cases of
admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies to which the United
States shall be a party; to controversies between two or more states, between
a state and citizens of another state, between citizens of different states,
between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different
States, and between a state, or the citizens thereof and foreign States,
citizens or subjects.
      In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls,
and those in which a state shall be a party, the supreme court shall have
original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before mentioned, the supreme
court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such
exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.
        The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by
jury; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall
have been committed; but when not committed within any state, the trial shall
be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed.

        Sect. 3.  Treason against the United States, shall consist only in
levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid
and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony
of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on open confession in open court.
        The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason,
but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture
except during the life of the person attainted.


                                   ARTICLE IV

        Sect. 1.  Full faith and credit shall be given in each state to the
public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state. And the
Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts, records
and proceedings shall be proved, and the effect thereof.
        
     Sect. 2.  The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges
and immunities of citizens in the several states.
        A person charged in any state with treason, felony, or other crime,
who shall flee from justice, and be found in another state, shall, on demand
of the executive authority of the state from which he fled, be delivered up,
to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the crime.
        No person held to service or labour in one state, under the laws
thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regula-
tion therein, be discharged from such service or labour, but shall be de-
livered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labour may be due.

        Sect. 3.  New states may be admitted by the Congress into this union;
but no new state shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any
other state; nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states,
or parts of states, without the consent of the legislatures of the states
concerned as well as of the Congress.
       The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules
and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the
United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to
prejudice any claims of the United States, or of any particular state.

        Sect. 4.  The United States shall guarantee to every state in this
union a Republican form of government, and shall protect each of them against
invasion; and on application of the legislature, or of the executive (when
the legislature cannot be convened) against domestic violence.


                                ARTICLE V.

        
    The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary,
shall propose amendments to this constitution, or, on the application of two-
thirds of the several states, shall call a convention for proposing amend-
ments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as
part of this constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths
of the several states, or by conventions in three-fourths thereof, as the one
or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided,
that no amendment which may be made prior to the year one thousand eight hun-
dred and eight shall in any manner affect the first and fourth clauses in the
ninth section of the first article; and that no state, without its consent,
shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the senate.








                               ARTICLE VI

       All debts contracted and engagements entered into, before the adoption
of this Constitution, shall be as valid against the United States under this
Constitution, as under the confederation.

made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made,
under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the
land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, any thing in the
constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.
