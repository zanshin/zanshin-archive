				<p style="text-indent: 0em;"><img src="images/truth.jpg" width=239 height=364 alt="" border="0" align="left">I have DUB, it is something I had never heard of until I got it.  I began to bleed about 3.5 years ago.  It was just 
				spotting at first and it was a nuisance.  Then after about 6 months I woke up one night to having huge clots passing.  It 
				was then that I began to understand that this was something I would have to contend with.  I began to wear protection whereas 
				up until now I was content to sit on towels.  I looked on the Internet and found information about DUB and felt as though I 
				understood something about it and that I would just have to learn to deal with it.  From what I understand it is a 
				pre-menopausal situation that about 10% of women get.  It typically lasts from 3 to 5 years.
				<br>
				<br>
				According to the information I have found there is little that the medical establishment knows about this and 
				even less that they can do.  The information all said that if the bleeding was light to moderate then just riding it out 
				was the best that I could do.  The information I found suggested that I eat well, get plenty of rest, and take vitamin A.  I am 
				doing all of these and most of the time I feel fine.  The medical establishment suggests I have a hysterectomy.  I know that there 
				would be a legacy from taking this option and I choose not to do it.  So I choose to ride it out and deal with this situation on a 
				daily basis.
				<br>
				<br>
				This log will be a daily log wherein I talk about what it is like today.  I am hoping that it reaches other women who have this 
				and that we help each other deal with it.  
				<br>
				<br>
				I will continue to keep a log of my DUB and my thoughts.  I hope that if you are reading this it connects with you as some level.
