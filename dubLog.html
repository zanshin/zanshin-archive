					<strong>Today is Monday, January 29, 2002</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				Yesterday I was able to go out to dinner with Mark.  This has become a real treat in that I am not as able 
				to do it as I once was.  After the incident on Saturday it is scary to go out knowing that I could start a 
				huge flow at any time.  I have had a few incidents of heavy flow while being out and it is very embarrassing.  
				I know that I have a lesson to learn from this, I just wish I could get it so I could just have it end.  There 
				is that part of me that wants to go to the doctor and have it taken care of.  I know however that this is not the 
				answer.  I know that the true answer lies in my learning the lessons and going from there.
				<br>
				<br>
				I am also a woman of weight and it has taken years to stop listening to all of the outside forces that want 
				me to lose the weight so that I can be "happy" and "healthy".  It is my opinion that I have had a number 
				of lessons to learn from being heavy and that I would just have to repeat this life style if I were to work 
				at changing the life without getting the lessons.  That would mean that I would have to come back next life 
				and be even heavier. Ergo I will let this life happen, as it should.  That means living it my way.  It is not 
				an easy path nor is it something anyone else understands.  I know that I have been given a great gift and that a 
				part of that gift is to learn to listen to myself instead of others.  I know that as I accept my weight and learn to 
				accept myself as I truly am instead of the person I am supposed to be I am much better off.  
				<br>
				<br>
				My emotional lesson this life is acceptance.  That means accepting myself where I am and not as others 
				would have it.  My weight has given me the opportunity to look at myself through the eyes of truth as opposed to 
				the mask it is so easy to accept.  As a result of this great gift I have been able to work more on my truth than 
				some other life times.  
				<br>
				<br>
				My spiritual lesson this lifetime is to help others see when they are lying to themselves.  I may not know 
				your truth, but I do know when someone else is lying to himself or herself.  I have been working on this 
				my whole life.  I picked circumstances that would help me look at myself through eyes of truth as opposed 
				to being able to hide.  I know everyone has something to work through, that is a part of being here.  I also 
				know that most of us are able to hide from this and just blend in.  It is harder to work through your emotional issues 
				if you are able to hide.  I know that I picked something I could not hide from this life so that I would 
				have an opportunity to be very honest.  
				<br>
				<br>
				I look at people who have worked through their emotional issues so that they could get to the truth of their spiritual 
				path.  Some of these would be Ghandi, Eleanor Roosevelt, Malcolm X, Jimmy Carter, Mother Theresa, Abraham 
				Lincoln, and others.  They worked on their emotional issues and were able to learn the lessons enough so they 
				could begin to work on their spiritual path.  I see that this is the lesson for all of us.  According to Abraham 
				Maslow there is a hierarchy of needs.  The first is safety needs.  This would be essential to physical life such 
				as food, shelter, and clothing.  Then come the emotional needs such as love, belongingness, affiliation, and 
				basically knowing what we need in the world to feel connected and a part of things.  Once we feel comfortable with 
				our ability to meet these needs we are then able to work on our spiritual needs, this means our true reason for being 
				here.  Everyone has a spiritual reason for being here and it is the purpose for coming into this 
				plane of existence.  I have been given the last 3 years of quiet as a gift to come to the realization of why 
				I am truly here.  For me I now see that my true spiritual path is to help others discover when they are lying to 
				themselves.

					<strong>Today is Friday, January 25, 2002</strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				I just came home from lunch out with my husband.  At the restaurant I began to soak through 
				my protection and I bled on the seat.  My husband went to the car and get more protection.  I went to the restroom and changed.  I 
				knew that I needed to get home and be near a bathroom.  So, we came home.  I am very lucky in that my husband is very supportive and 
				helps me deal with this.  Today he cleaned the restaurant seat, gathered my belongings and met me outside the ladies room.  He 
				brought me home, even though we had planned to go to the store.  He cleaned the car seat and helped me clean the clothes I was wearing.
				<br>
				<br>
				I believe that we get what we need in this life and that our job is to learn the lesson from what happens.  I believe that I got 
				this DUB as a life lesson, and that my job is to get the lesson.  I am not sure what the lesson is yet, evidence that I still 
				have it.  But, I do know that a part of it is to let someone help me.  I grew up in a household where I could not really count 
				on anyone.  I learned to rely upon me.  Now I need the lesson in how to let someone be there for me.  It is very difficult and 
				I struggle with it often.  I thank my husband often and recognize that I would not be able to make it without him.  I cannot work 
				right now because I never know when one of these episodes will strike.  I have had them happen out in public a few times and it 
				is devastating.  Especially now when blood is so frightening to everyone.  It also wipes me out physically.  Afterward I am not 
				able to do much.  I am having to learn to be quite and still.  This is very hard for me.  I have always been a very hard working 
				woman.  I am learning more and more about me as a result of having this time to myself.  I am very fortunate to have someone to 
				help me with this.  I am also very fortunate to have someone who works and does well.  I know that I have been given this as a 
				gift, but I am still learning to accept it as one.  I am a woman of weight as well, and over time I have learned to see my weight 
				as a gift and to see how it has helped me.  I have learned to see myself as good and enough as I am.  I could not hide behind 
				anything because my difference was very apparent.  Perhaps one of the gifts of my DUB is about having a difference that is more 
				hidden.  I just got that.
