                color="#9932CC" size="3">There is only one person
                we<br>
                must encounter during our life, <br>
                a person we must meet as if we were in passionate
                love.<br>
                Who is that person?<br>
                It is the essential Self, the True Self.<br>
                You must meet this person<br>
                And as long as you do not,<br>
                It will be impossible to truly be satisfied in
                your heart.<br>
                To meet your self is said to be the purpose of
                human life.<br>
                This is also the objective of Buddhism.<br>
                The shortest, most concrete way to do this is
                Zen.<br>
                <br>
                Why is it that people worry and suffer?<br>
                Why is it that people seek for peace of mind and
                satori?<br>
                It is all because of the activity of ego-self
                created opinions.<br>
                Shakyamuni Buddha was the first human being<br>
                to realize that obstacles to the Way of reaching
                True Awakening<br>
                are ego-self created opinions.<br>
                By truly being one with these delusive ego-self
                created opinions,<br>
                he realized No Self.<br>
                <br>
                What is Zen?<br>
                It is to live your everyday life accepting all
                facets of reality<br>
                without mixing in ego-self created opinions.<br>
                <br>
                What is reality?<br>
                Understanding, not understanding, unclear,
                ambiguous:<br>
                These are all your reality.<br>
                Other than your own reality,<br>
                There is nothing else to seek.<br>
                <br>
                What is anger? What is ignorance? What is greed?<br>
                It is to Thoroughly and without resistance accept
                these<br>
                things as they are.<br>
                <br>
                Zen refers to our life and reality itself.<br>
                It is to be one with anxiety as it is or haste as
                it is<br>
                without seeking for peace of mind or a quiet
                condition.<br>
                Without thinking on your own that:<br>
                &quot;Anger is mistaken and happiness is correct<br>
                Sadness is bad and comfort is good&quot;,<br>
                the practice of quietly making reality your own<br>
                is the practice of Zen.</font></p>
