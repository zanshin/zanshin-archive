  don't like changes in my schedule. Perhaps this is some character flaw, perhaps 
  it is genetic. Maybe I'm just goofy. At any rate I don't like it when things 
  change. A small change in what I perceive to be my normal schedule can upset 
  me for hours. For example my normal commute to work lasts about 40 minutes. 
  This is door-to-door travel time. The rest of my daily schedule more or less 
  depends on this commute time staying the same. Naturally traffic doesn't always 
  cooperate with me and often my drive is an hour or longer. The rest of the day 
  I feel harried and out of control. This obsession doesn't limit itself to little 
  things like driving time either. My brother, who lives 1000 miles away, just 
  informed us of his wedding date. Now my whole year is shot. I have to use vacation 
  time in order to attend his wedding. Getting all the flight and driving times 
  down is eating away at me already. In order to feel comfortable I need to have 
  control over all these little facts. I want to put them all in order and glue 
  them in place so I can start to feel safe with them. The worst part is I don't 
  have any real control over them. Sure I could buy a ticket today, and make car 
  and hotel reservations. But then it is out of my control again. Now I am at 
  the mercy of total strangers. And mercy is a rare commodity in today's society.</font>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So 
  far in my life this obsession hasn't been too harmful. But now I feel it is 
  starting to intrude. Given that I have to commute to work, and that the variance 
  in driving time can approach 300% I have to learn to let go of the need to have 
  control over time. I need to let go of the need to always be at work by 7, eat 
  lunch at 12, and leave for home at 4 on the dot. Getting here at 9 works just 
  as well. You just stay until 6. Same number of hours. Same place, same people, 
  same everything. Only it isn't the same. Part of this, as far as work is concerned, 
  has to do with the energy of the place. Getting there early usually means I 
  am the first person through the door. The building is quiet and empty. I get 
  to fill it with my energy. Being the first to work as always been popular with 
  me. In each of my previous 4 jobs I have managed to alter my schedule from the 
  normal 8 - 5 or 9 -6 hours, to hours of my own choosing. Usually I am at my 
  desk by 7 am. For a period of time I was getting to work at 6 am. Thinking back 
  over the years I can distinctly remember times when I would arrive at 6 or 6:30 
  and discover someone else had "beaten" me there. I hated those days. My time 
  alone at work had been invaded. I had lost control of the situation. </font>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Maybe 
  I don't like people all that much. I have always enjoyed working on Saturday 
  when there was no one else in the building. I relish the idea of have it all 
  to myself. I can control the lighting and climate without some one altering 
  my settings. I've never had an office of my own with a door. I think that would 
  be ideal for me. No matter when I got to work I could isolate myself from the 
  intrusions of others. ("If the door is shut it means I don't want to see you.") 
  Currently I share a u-shaped cubical that faces another row of u-shaped cubicles. 
  Privacy is a myth. I hate the feeling of being exposed and of being on display. 
  Other than having my own office with a door, I think working at home and tele-commuting 
  is the best answer for me. I still get to interact with my peers, but I have 
  lots of control over my immediate environment.</font>
