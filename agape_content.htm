        <td width="90%"><font face="Verdana">Agapé is a term
        which means 'total love and acceptance'. We believe that
        the ultimate goal of every essence living on this planet
        is to attain a state Agapé. </font><p><font
        face="Verdana">Most of us learn conditional love and
        conditional acceptance from our life experiences. This
        input comes at us from all sides. Our families, schools,
        media, friends, and indeed, ourselves.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">How many times have we all heard
        words to this effect, &quot;If you would only do
        this&quot;, &quot;If you would only be this&quot;,
        &quot;I love you, but...&quot; Over and over we are
        conditioned to believe that love is supposed to have
        strings. If you aren't perfect then you can't be totally
        loved and accepted. Of course this begs the question,
        what is perfect.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">We are all perfect. Each of us is
        exactly the way we are for a reason - To learn something
        from this life experience. Fighting what we are in order
        to meet the popularly held ideal of perfect is to fight
        one's own nature. Fighting who you real are negates the
        very purpose of your life here. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">Only by challenging yourself to
        let go of society's conditional acceptance standards can
        you begin to truly love yourself. Letting go of these
        &quot;false&quot; acceptance signals is extremely
        difficult, but the reward is well worth the effort.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">You are, right now this instant,
        perfect. You are enough, exactly the way you are. You are
        loved for who and what you are inside. </font></p>
